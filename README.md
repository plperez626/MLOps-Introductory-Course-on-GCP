# MLOPS ON GCP Course : lecture slides and lab notebooks

This course is being taught at as part of [Master Year 2 Data Science Supaero](https://supaerodatascience.github.io/index.html)

## Motivation

MLOps is a rapidly evolving field that combines machine learning and software engineering to streamline the deployment, monitoring, and maintenance of machine learning models in production. As machine learning systems become increasingly complex, the need for robust workflows and efficient collaboration between data scientists and engineers grows. This class will focus on the tools and practices that enable teams to develop and deploy machine learning models at scale. The goal is to equip students with the skills necessary to manage the full lifecycle of machine learning models, from experimentation to deployment and monitoring, using industry-standard tools and platforms.

## Syllabus

The course covers the basics of MLOps, applied on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

### Lecture slides

- Tracking experiments, evaluating models, iterating on model versiongs using Mlflow
- Setting up and using FlowML on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Deploying and serving models with scalable inference methods (batch and streaming)
- Implementing an ML pipeline with CI/CD/CT
- Final project: Deploying a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Chatbot on Vertex AI
