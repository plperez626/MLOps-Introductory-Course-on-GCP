This approach involves breaking answers into smaller parts to allow the\\r\\nmodel to explore the solution space systematically. To facilitate this, we prompt the model to\\r\\ngenerate multiple tags that correspond to specific reasoning steps necessary for the search. For\\r\\ntraining, we first use collected prompts to find answers via MCTS guided by a pre-trained value\\r\\nmodel. Subsequently, we use the resulting question-answer pairs to train both the actor model\\r\\nand the value model, iteratively refining the process.\\r\\nHowever, this approach encounters several challenges when scaling up the training. First,\\r\\nunlike chess, where the search space is relatively well-defined, token generation presents an\\r\\n15exponentially larger search space. To address this, we set a maximum extension limit for each\\r\\nnode, but this can lead to the model getting stuck in local optima. Second, the value model\\r\\ndirectly influences the quality of generation since it guides each step of the search process.\\r\\nTraining a fine-grained value model is inherently difficult, which makes it challenging for the\\r\\nmodel to iteratively improve. While AlphaGo\\342\\200\\231s core success relied on training a value model to\\r\\nprogressively enhance its performance, this principle proves difficult to replicate in our setup\\r\\ndue to the complexities of token generation.\\r\\nIn conclusion, while MCTS can improve performance during inference when paired with a\\r\\npre-trained value model, iteratively boosting model performance through self-search remains a\\r\\nsignificant challenge.\\r\\n5. Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Work\\r\\nIn this work, we share our journey in enhancing model reasoning abilities through reinforcement\\r\\nlearning. DeepSeek-R1-Zero represents a pure RL approach without relying on cold-start\\r\\ndata, achieving strong performance across various tasks. DeepSeek-R1 is more powerful,\\r\\nleveraging cold-start data alongside iterative RL fine-tuning.\"\n",
